# insurance-broker-app

A simple web application for managing and listing brokers of trustworthy agencies.

## Running the application

## Decisions & Disclaimer

### Monorepo vs Polyrepo

Both approaches has [pros and cons](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3328433.3328435) and, technically, neither displays a solid outhmatch. Here, I preferred conveying all frontend and backend components in a single repository as it is a basic application. Yet, I kept `.gitignore` files in subdirectories in order to make possible future separations smoother.

## Privacy

Even if this repository is a private one and not available for disttribution. In order to further guarantee the confidentiality, the owner states that no license is included intentionally so that it has [no public permission](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).
